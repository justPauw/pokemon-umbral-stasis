## Welcome to the Umbral Stasis Wikipedia
This game is still in a fairly early development. On the left side you may browse different types of available content and information. There is quite a few changes done to both stats and typings of some Pokémon, especially some starter and legendary Pokémon. In the "What's New" section below you can find a few examples.

This game only contains Pokémon from Generation 1-5 with some newer legendaries and mythicals, and playing with the idea that Generation 1-5 is its own Timeline, since Generation 6 introduced Mega Evolution. This game contains no battle gimmicks, however there is new forms of Pokémon like Ancient Pokémon, Umbral Pokémon and Delta Pokémon.

## What is new?
=== "Pokémon"
    ### Starter Pokémon
    ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/YdL51sH/allstarters.png){ align=right }
    In the region of Yamoh, there is no dedicated Starter Pokémon, so with the help of other professors, Rayleigh was able to acquire Starer Pokémon from other regions. You will have the option to pick any starter you wish from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh and Unova.

    Your choice of Starter does not affect your rivals team, as they will have a good counter to any of the Starter typings. You may want to look up the Wiki Page for the Starter you want to pick, as some of them have new Stat spread, Ability and Typings.

    For example, Typhlosion is now a Fire/Ground typing, and they have a new Stat spread and not just a copy paste of Charizard. They also have a new Ability and Hidden Ability.

    !!! note 
        Not all Starter Pokémon have new type, stat spread and abilities. But they have all received a new secondary normal Ability. However when you receive your Starter they will always have the standard Overgrowth, Torrent and Blaze Abilities.
    ??? warning "Ancient Pokémon - Contains Spoilers"
        ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/DK6T25S/allancient.png){ align=right }
        Ancient Pokémon, found in the Primal Vivarium inside of the Fossil Laboratory, contains Pokémon of an era long gone. In the current time, we have revived these Pokémon as Fossils. But after the the events of the Past, Steven Stone brought back pure DNA samples, unaffected by the fossilization process. These samples were used to revive what we know as Fossil Pokémon, but in their true forms.

        To unlock this area, you must defeat the Pokémon League.

    The Main Story of Umbral Stasis takes place in the Yamoh Region.

        Early development

=== "Changes"
    ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/995Y0YV/allstuff.png){ align=right }
    ### Typings
    Several Pokémon has had their typings changed, or added a secondary one. As a few examples, Flygon is now a Bug/Dragon Pokémon, Golduck is a Water/Psychic and Altaria is a Dragon/Fairy.

    Most Pokémon that has had type changes is to either improve them, or change them into a typing I feel they should have had in the first place, as with Flygon. Every Starter Pokémon has now a dual typing, like Blastoise becoming a Water/Steel. Most of the secondary typings dont appear until the final evolution.

    ### Stat Spread
    There has been some stat changes to certain Pokémon. A good example is Aggron, becoming Yamoh's Psudo-Legendary Pokémon with a BST of 600. There is also Pokémon that has had minor boost like Lopunny and some with complete changes like Dusknoir. Being overshadowed by its pre-evolution with eviolite, Dusknoir usually serves no purpose. So now, when Dusclops evolves into Dusknoir, it sacrifices its normal defenses for offenses, giving it a new playstyle.

    ### Abilities
    New abilities has been added to the game. Alot of them are unique abilities for Legendary and Pokémon involved in the story. You can find them all under "Ability Changes" on the left side.

    Alot of new Pokémon has had their abilities changed or added a new secondary ability. Like the Starter Pokémon all have a secondary ability now, but you will need to catch one with it or get an Ability Capsule.

=== "Moves"
    ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/7nmWLs4/allregi.png){ align=right }
    ### Moves
    Moves like Fire Fang, Ice Fang and Thunder Fang has gotten upgraded version in the form of Searing Fang, Frigid Fang and Voltic Fang. There is alot of new moves added like Carbon Crush, Pixie Munch, Silver Sear, Petal Darts and Rustic Gnaw. Most of these moves are available as TMs.

    You'll be able to find most TMs in the overworld, the rest are available as in NPC traders.

    A few new Unique Moves have been added to Legendary Pokémon. A few examples being the Regi's getting Titanic Impact for Regigigas, Titanic Boulder for Regirock, Titanic Cryobeam for Regice and Titanic Steelwork for Registeel. All of these moves have secondary effects to match.


=== "Shinies"
    ### Shiny Pokémon
    ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/rpT1HND/allshinies.png){ align=right }
    We've all seen some of the less than cool shiny Pokémon, and the older ones are excused by how they were generated in the code. But I have always wished for some updated shinies for older Pokémon. Some of them, such as Gengar, Garchomp and even the mascot, Pikachu, has pretty boring shinies. 
    
    I decided to updated, change and modify some shiny Pokémon I either didn't like or felt deserved a better one. If you disagree with them, that's fine, not all the new shinies are for Pokémon with bad shinies.

    Most Starter Pokémon has gotten a new shiny. There is a few that has only had minor adjustment or no change, like Emboar with minor change, Charizard with no change, and Torterra with full change.
