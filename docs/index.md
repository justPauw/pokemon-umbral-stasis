## Welcome to the Pokémon Umbral Stasis Wikipedia
This game is still in a fairly early development. On the left side you may browse different types of available content and information. There is quite a few changes done to both stats and typings of some Pokémon, especially some starter and legendary Pokémon. In the "What's New" section below you can find a few examples.

This game only contains Pokémon from Generation 1-5 with some newer legendaries and mythicals, and playing with the idea that Generation 1-5 is its own Timeline, since Generation 6 introduced Mega Evolution. This game contains no battle gimmicks, however there is new forms of Pokémon like Ancient Pokémon, Umbral Pokémon and Delta Pokémon.

## What is new?
=== "Pokémon"
    ??? info "Starter Pokémon"
        ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/YdL51sH/allstarters.png){ align=right }
        In the region of Yamoh, there is no dedicated Starter Pokémon, so with the help of other professors, Rayleigh was able to acquire Starer Pokémon from other regions. You will have the option to pick any starter you wish from Kanto, Johto, 
        Hoenn, Sinnoh and Unova.

        Your choice of Starter does not affect your rivals team, as they will have a good counter to any of the Starter typings. You may want to look up the Wiki Page for the Starter you want to pick, as some of them have new Stat spread, Ability and Typings.

        For example, Typhlosion is now a Fire/Ground typing, and they have a new Stat spread and not just a copy paste of Charizard. They also have a new Ability and Hidden Ability.

        !!! note 
            Not all Starter Pokémon have new Type, Stat spread and Abilities. But they have all received a new secondary normal Ability. However when you receive your Starter they will always have the standard Overgrowth, Torrent and Blaze Abilities.
    ??? info "Ancient Pokémon - Contains Spoilers"
        ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/DK6T25S/allancient.png){ align=right }
        Ancient Pokémon, found in the Primal Vivarium inside of the Fossil Laboratory, contains Pokémon of an era long gone. In the current time, we have revived these Pokémon as Fossils. But after the the events of the Past, Steven Stone brought back pure DNA samples, unaffected by the fossilization process. These samples were used to revive what we know as Fossil Pokémon, but in their true forms.

        To unlock this area, you must defeat the Pokémon League.

=== "Shinies"
    ![Image title](https://i.ibb.co/rpT1HND/allshinies.png){ align=right }
    We've all seen some of the less than cool shiny Pokémon, and the older ones are excused by how they were generated in the code. But I have always wished for some updated shinies for older Pokémon. Some of them, such as Gengar, Garchomp and even the mascot, Pikachu, has pretty boring shinies. 
    
    I decided to updated, change and modify some shiny Pokémon I either didn't like or felt deserved a better one. If you disagree with them, that's fine, not all the new shinies are for Pokémon with bad shinies.

    Most Starter Pokémon has gotten a new shiny. There is a few that has only had minor adjustment or no change, like Emboar with minor change, Charizard with no change, and Torterra with full change.
